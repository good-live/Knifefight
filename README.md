# Knifefight

A lightweigth version of the knifefight Plugin for sourcemod.
Poorly coded and not recommended to use.
Feel free to fork this and make it a better version.

## Commands

* sm_addspawn (Root)
Just simply add a spawn for the knifefight.

The very first spawn is for T's and the second one for CT's.
There is no option to view or edit these spawns. You have to go to configs/knifefight/MAPNAME.txt to edit the spawns (or delete that file and create new spawns)


## Config
Config file get's generated automaticly and is self explanatory.

## Game Support
Currently only CS:GO is supported.
Other games WILL NOT WORK (Maybe CS:S ^^).

## Features
* Menu based Invitation to fight.
* Teleport to each other or a predefined spawn.
* Counter until the fight ends.
* Beacon so they don't get lost.
* Chicken Sound Effect when somebody declines the fight.
